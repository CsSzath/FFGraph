# FFGraph - Heat Treatment Data Evaluation and Storage

## Introduction
FFGraph is an application designed to graphically evaluate and store the exported CSV heat-treatment files of an industrial smoker-cooker chambers made by KORAX Gépgyár Kft. The app ensures compliance with legal requirements by allowing users to analyze and store critical heat treatment data.

## Features
- Import and store CSV files generated by the machine's Control PLC.
- Graphically evaluate heat treatment data, including:
  - Air temperature
  - Core temperature
  - Humidity
  - Process steps
- Re-export CSV files from database, containing the data stored

## Data Structure
Each record in the original input CSV file contains:
- **#**: <int> index of the record
- **Date**: <int> converted to YY/MM/DD, from 1900.01.01
- **Time**: <float> converted to HH:MM:SS
- **Milliseconds**: <int> milliseconds in TimeOfDay
- **Day of Week**: <int> Day of the week by number [1...7]
- **Interval Time ms**: <int> time since process recording started
- **Sub Interval Time ms**: <int> time since last record was saved
- **Triggered**: <int> 0 - if record was saved automatically (time interval), 1 - if the save event was triggered by program
- **Kamra hőm. Values**: <int> Air temperature inside the machine [00.0°C]
- **Mag hőm. Value**: <int> Core temperature of the product [00.0°C]
- **Pára**: <int> Inside the chamber [%]
- **Lépés típus Values**: <int> (e.g., Drying, Cooking, Smoking, etc.)
- **Kamra beáll. Values**: <int> Set air temperature in the treatment program [00°C]
- **Mag beáll. Values**: <int> Set core temperature in the treatment program [00°C]
- **Pára beáll. Values**: <int> Set Humidity in the treatment program [%]

## Legal Compliance
According to regulations, the heat treatment data must:
- Prove that the product received the necessary heat treatment.
- Demonstrate that the required bacteria-killing thresholds were met.
- Be stored and made available for inspection by officials if required.
- It is the user's responsibility to use the software appropriately, ensure the integrity of the database, and provide accurate, non-falsified data for the program.
